    "1. IDRE's Jupyter Hub: The first and recommended option is to use the class Jupyter Hub server that is hosted by IDRE. You will need to use your UCLA multi-factor authentication to login.\n",
    "1. The second option is to install Jupyter yourself on your local machines. This has many pitfalls, in that each machine is configured differently, and may have difficulties mirroring the needed environments to run applications smoothly and in sync with the class. However, this may be recommended for more advanced users, and those who are comfortable working with the command prompt, setting up conda environments, and installing and updating necessary python libraries. Note that if you choose to run your own local jupyter environment for this course, support will be limited!\n",
