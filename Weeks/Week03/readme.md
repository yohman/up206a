## Lecture
*   Welcome to week 3!
    * Concerns?
    * How to ask a question
      * Ask Google and Stackoverflow first
      * Provide minimum reproducible code that produces error
      * Include a notebook file (.ipynb) AND associated data files (if shapefile, zip all files)
      * Alternatively, provide a link to a github repo that has your notebook and datafiles
*   Conversation Series #1: Silvia Gonzales
*   Census Data

## Hands on
*   Census data exploration in python using pandas

## Assignments

### Group Assignment #2: Census Data Exploration

For this group assignment, you will create and submit a Jupyter Notebook. The first cell of the notebook should be a markdown cell that includes a title and description of the assignment.

1.   Download census variables relevant to your research question (if you are working outside of the United States, consult with me to find an alternative dataset)
1.   Create a Jupyter Notebook and use pandas to explore and visualize the data
1.   Produce several charts, including one or more maps
1.   Make sure to document each procedure with markdown cells with relevant headers
1.   Run the cells in the notebook, and make sure the notebook "reads" from top to bottom, telling a story
1.   At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each member of the group and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each)
1.   Upload the Jupyter Notebook to your group repo
1.   Email me when you are done

### Reading Assignment

Next week, we will have our second guest speaker [Geoff Beoing](https://geoffboeing.com/about/) for the class. Here, I present two of his readings. One introduces you to OSMNX, a python module he built for the purposes of allowing network analysis with Open Street Map data. I also list his latest paper, which looks at the evolution of American street network design, and how the use of data science tools can inform our perspective and knowledge on the evolution of urban networks.

1.   Create a markdown file in your repo titled `Week3_Reading_Assignment.md`
1.   Write a one-two paragraph reaction to the readings. What spoke to you, and how does it inform your approach to your own research?
1.   Provide at least two comments or questions you would like to ask the author.
